Visit Business Insider's Tech Reference library for more stories. Compared to other smartwatches, the Apple Watch does not have a particularly robust battery life.An Apple Watch lasts for just 18 hours, which means you need to charge it daily. Most people charge it overnight, which is why it doesn't have a built-in sleep tracking app like many other smartwatches and fitness bands. Why your Apple Watch battery dies so fast, and how to fix itIf your watch isn't lasting all the way through the day, it's likely that you are using the watch's battery a lot more aggressively than the average user.

      "16144 a small boat in a body of water:  On December 21, a Chilean research base in Antarctica reported the first cases of coronavirus on the remote continent. For months, Antarctica remained untouched by the virus, and researchers' lives had been as normal as pre-pandemic conditions. That life, which is met with freezing weather and dark winters, is no easy feat. Here's a look at what life is like in the research stations in Antarctica. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. For months, one of the few places in the world without a single reported case of the coronavirus was the expansive, remote continent of Antarctica.That changed on Monday, when a Chilean research base reported 36 cases of COVID-19, local paper El Mercurio reported. The 26 Army personnel and 10 civilian contractors who tested positive for the virus are in good condition and have been evacuated to Chile, according to The Guardian. Antarctica is the only continent with no native human population, and many of its inhabitants are researchers on the hunt for new organisms, data that could reveal Earth's climate history, and signs of a changing environment.For nearly 200 years, scientists have been exploring the nearly 5.5-million-square-mile continent. In 1959, the US and 11 other countries signed the Antarctic Treaty to ban military activity and promote scientific investigations. Currently, there are 70 research bases on the continent, and that number has grown over the decades. Thousands of biologists, ecologists, and geologists conduct research in the coldest, driest, and most remote continent on Earth. Take a look at some of these researchers' daily lives and the challenges these scientists face.Read the original article on Insider\n",
